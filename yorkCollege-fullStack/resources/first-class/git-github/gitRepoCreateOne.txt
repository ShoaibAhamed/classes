2. from the GitHub repo, copy repo's HTTP link

3. go to terminal, the directory where you want to set your local git repo, write - git clone then-paste-the-HTTP-link

4. you can see the folder downloaded in your desktop.

5. create a file in that local git repo.

6. git status to see the git repo

7. git add the file name or "git add ." for all files

8. Once added, in the terminal write git commit -m "what are you changing"

9. Write git push and then go to your GitHub remote repo to refresh and see the changes. 

10. Add some more points in the text file. 

11. git status shows red lines. 

12. write "git add ." to add the changes

13. write "git commit -m "added some more points"

14. git status

15. git push

16. refresh remote git repo

17. go to your remote repo, edit the file by adding one new line and press commit button

18. come back to terminal, write "git pull"

19. It will pull all the changes made in the other hand and your local directory is up to date.
