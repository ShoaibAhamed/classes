Bootstrap: Gallery Exercise
The goal of this exercise is to use the CSS components 
you've learned so far from Bootstrap to create a gallery of your work or hobbies on your website.


Part 1: Setup
Make a copy of your index.html from the previous exercise.
Name it gallery.html 
and save it in the same folder as your index.html.
Delete the main content from gallery.html, but keep the header, 
navigation, and footer if you have it.
Paste this starter code into your gallery.html instead. 
You will not use that exact content, but use the HTML structure as a general template for your own content.

Part 2: Create gallery!
Create cards
Use the card content type classes such as .card-block and .card-text to create your cards.

Use the .card-column class to organize your cards like a Pinterest board.
Bonus
Organize your cards into different sections.

Add links to your cards that open in a new tab; include the attribute target="_blank".
