		<h1 style = "color:red;"> Florence Live Updates: First Deaths Reported in North Carolina</h1>
		<h2> Run!</h2>
		<p>NEW BERN, N.C. â€” Tropical Storm Florence continued to thrash the Carolinas on Friday evening with fierce winds, driving rain and catastrophic flooding. Downgraded from hurricane strength after making landfall near <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilmington,_North_Carolina" target = "_blank">Wilmington, N.C.</a>, the storm had killed at least four people, the authorities said, and trapped hundreds of others whose rescues continued as night fell. The rains are anticipated to continue for days, and flooding is likely to worsen as more rivers spill over their banks.</p>
